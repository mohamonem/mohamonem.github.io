I am a PhD candidate at [Simula UiB](https://simula-uib.com/), specializing in Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) under the supervision of Håvard Raddum. My research focuses on the physical attacks and countermeasures on post-quantum schemes.

Before starting my PhD, I completed both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mathematics at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/) in Germany. During my Master’s studies, I wrote my thesis in collaboration with [Infineon Technologies](https://www.infineon.com/) in Munich, where I investigated fault injection countermeasures for lattice-based cryptography, which resulted in a patent application.

Earlier, I spent several months as a research intern at [KDDI R&D Laboratories](https://www.kddi-research.jp/english) in Japan, where I worked on optimizing Information Set Decoding (ISD) attacks in code-based cryptography. The results of this work were presented at [SCIS 2023](https://www.iwsec.org/scis/2023/index_en.html) in Kokura.
